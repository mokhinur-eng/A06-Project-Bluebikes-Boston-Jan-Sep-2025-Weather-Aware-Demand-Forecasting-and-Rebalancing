        "<p align='justify'>Bluebikes experiences noticeable swings in rider demand when the weather shifts, which often leaves some stations empty and others completely full. This creates reliability issues for riders and puts additional pressure on the operations team responsible for moving bikes around the city. Our project looks at how weather patterns relate to trip volumes so that the system can better anticipate high- or low-use periods and plan rebalancing efforts more effectively. The primary stakeholders are the Bluebikes operations group and Boston’s transportation planners, who rely on accurate demand expectations to allocate staff, schedule truck routes, and reduce service disruptions. We will measure success through the accuracy of our demand forecasts and by identifying conditions that are most likely to contribute to empty or full stations.</p>"

        "<p align='justify'>This project analyzes how hourly weather conditions influence Bluebikes usage across Boston from January through September 2025. After cleaning and unifying both trip-level and weather data, we examined trends across stations, rider types, and extreme weather scenarios to identify which conditions most strongly shape demand. The analysis shows clear patterns: commuter-heavy stations around MIT and Central Square stay busy in all weather, weekend ridership shifts heavily toward casual users, and rain or cold reduces demand far more than heat. By isolating which stations are resilient versus weather-sensitive, we highlight where rebalancing pressure is most likely to occur during storms or winter cold snaps. These insights support more accurate demand forecasting and more efficient operational planning, helping Bluebikes maintain consistent bike availability while reducing the risk of stations becoming empty or full.</p>\n",

While warm and clear days consistently push ridership above 18,000–22,000 trips, overall demand dips noticeably in June and early July when most university students leave the city and many commuters take summer vacations. In contrast, September produces some of the highest daily counts of the year, often exceeding 20,000 trips; because ideal fall weather overlaps with the return of more than 100,000 students across MIT, Harvard, BU, and Northeastern. These dynamics confirm that both weather and the academic calendar play major roles in shaping demand, which will be important to account for when building seasonal and weather-aware forecasting models.\n"

For operations, bikes must be shifted later in the day, because PM periods consistently carry the highest demand regardless of temperature, especially in warmer months."

Stations like Ames St at Main St and MIT Vassar St see the biggest morning “outflow” of riders heading toward work or classes and then take those riders back in the evening, which highlights how important they are to daily travel. The busiest route pairs back this up, since the top O-D connections all link MIT buildings, Vassar Street, and Mass Ave; basically forming the main backbone of the bike network.</p>\n",

        "<p align='justify'>Weather plays a major role too, and not every station reacts the same way. Commuter-heavy stations stay relatively stable even in colder temperatures or light rain. But recreational and waterfront spots drop off fast when the weather turns bad; especially with rain elasticity values as low as −0.7 to −0.9 at stations like Murphy Skating Rink or Reservoir Rd at Beacon St. This shows that some parts of the system are far more weather-sensitive than others.</p>\n",
